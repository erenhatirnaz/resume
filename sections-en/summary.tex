\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}
I am a software developer who always keeps simplicity in mind while writing code,
and pays attention to learning new things and using what I have learned in
appropriate places. I am a fast learner and easily adaptable. I continue to
improve myself in problem solving and building algorithms rather than a specific
programming language. I like to collect feedback on my work.

I am also a supporter of Open Source and Free Software. I like to contribute to
the open source projects I use and develop open source projects/libraries.
